we don't have a solid DNI criteria, but we want nothing to do with those who self-proclaim themselves as 'proshippers'. dark topics should be explored within fiction, but not under the guise of fandomization. this is not, and will never be, respectful to victims.
in addition, fakeclaiming and syscourse has no place in a community that is already stigmatized as is. this includes people in our inbox telling us we're not a system. i hate to break it to you, but an anonymous message isn't going to make us stop expressing who we are. suck it up and block me.

i apologise if we block or otherwise act a little standoffish towards other skins of myself or my wife! i'm trying to get better about it, but it's nothing personal.

**we are a supporter of all good-faith identities & block liberally to curate our own experience.**
