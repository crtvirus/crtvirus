we don't have a solid DNI criteria, but we want nothing to do with those who self-proclaim themselves as 'proshippers'. dark topics should be explored within fiction, but not under the guise of fandomization. this is not, and will never be, respectful to victims.

in addition, fakeclaiming and syscourse has no place in a community that is already stigmatized as is. help eachother rather than putting one another down. there are no net-positives to faking plurality, so stop accusing people.

i apologise if we block or otherwise act a little standoffish towards other skins of myself or my wife! i'm trying to get better about it, but it's nothing personal.

**we are a supporter of all good-faith identities & block liberally to curate our own experience.**
